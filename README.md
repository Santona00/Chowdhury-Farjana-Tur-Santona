# Chowdhury-Farjana-Tur-Santona

My name is Chowdhury Farjana Tur Santona. I am a Computer Science graduate from the Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST) in Bangladesh. In my account, you will find repositories for the projects and research I have worked on over the past few years. Each repository reflects my commitment to making AI solutions more human-centric and accessible for diverse users.

My research interests lie in Artificial Intelligence and human computer interaction, with a strong focus on usability, security and user experience (UX). I aim to create technologies that prioritize inclusivity and efficiency. My favorite programming language is C++ and Python, but I also work with Java. Tools I have used are Streamlit, Google Colab, Visual Studio Code, Netbeans and Blender etc, where I frequently work with web technologies like HTML and CSS.

If you are interested in my work, feel free to explore my publications and tools, such as my multi-disease detection system built on Streamlit, and publications from my undergraduate thesis.

While my current focus is on AI and HCI, my career as a researcher began with my participation in the science team of MIST Mongol Barota and doing undergraduate thesis in "Explainable AI based Solar radiation prediction using machine learning and deep learning", which have been presented at international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. If this aspect of my work interests you, you can find detailed findings in my research papers and presentations.

Note: I am always open to sharing ideas, collaborating on projects, or receiving feedback on my work. Don’t hesitate to send me a message if you’d like to connect!
